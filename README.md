## Description
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This weather dashboard application uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The application is good for travelers that want to plan their trip accordingly.
